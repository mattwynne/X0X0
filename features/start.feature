Feature: Start

  If you're half way through a game and abandon it, or even if
  you've finished playing, there should be a way to reset the 
  board and start again.

  Hitting the start button should:
  
    - blank out all the cells on the board
    - reset any indicators about who has won
    - reset any indicators about whos turn it is
